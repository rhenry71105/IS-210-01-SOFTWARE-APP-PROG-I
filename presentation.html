            <section><blockquote>
<p>It’s a team sport, but one player can make a huge impact. Basketball is a team sport, but you have a greater opportunity to shine and have an outsized impact on the outcome of the game.
Basketball is one of the cheapest sports to play. One basketball and two hoops (sometimes even just one!) are all you need for a game that could work for up to ten people at once.
Physically, it’s probably one of the best for the human body. Most professional athletes are in pretty darn fantastic shape.
In basketball, you can play one-on-one or up to ten people at once. Basketball is awesome because no matter how many people you have, you can play. If you’re on your own, you can still shoot the ball, which is extremely therapeutic.</p>

<h1>Fun Facts About Basketball.</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>In the early 1900s, basketball players played in cages of chicken wire and mesh to keep players from falling into spectator seats. Players would often get injured during the intense games.</em></li>
<li><em>Originally, two teams of 9 players made up a basketball game, a number that was based on the standard number of players on a baseball team. Later, the teams were reduced to 5 players on the court</em></li>
<li><em>The first basketball hoops were peach baskets with the bottom intact. Officials had to get the ball out after each basket. The first-string nets were used in the early 1900s</em></li>

<li><em>The Basketball Association of America and the National Basketball League merged on August 5, 1976, creating the National Basketball Association (NBA)</em></li>
<li><em>The recommended air pressure for most basketballs is between 7 and 9 pounds per square inch (PSI). The NBA requires all game balls to be inflated between 7.3 and 8.5 PSI. WNBA balls have an air pressure limit of 9 PSI</em></li>
